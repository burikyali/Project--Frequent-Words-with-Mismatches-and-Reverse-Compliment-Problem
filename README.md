# Project--Frequent Words with Mismatches and Reverse Compliment Problem
 Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham SEM 2 Biology End Sem Project

In the genome of every species, there exists an
origin, known as the origin of replication (ORI), from where the
genome starts to replicate itself during the process of cell
division. Finding out this origin; is therefore a very prime and
demanding problem in bioinformatics research, as this is the
main responsible key-factor for the replication process of DNA.
In this study we start off by choosing a benchmark dataset of a
Frequent words with mismatch and reverse complement
problem. We are using python as our programming language to
find the solution to our problem. We are finding the solution to
find the replication origin (Oric region)
